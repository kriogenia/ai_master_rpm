## Generating problems

The problems of the project are generated using
[https://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/files/phub1.txt].
A new `just` recipe was created to ease the generation of new
subproblems in the resources folder to easily run them with the
project. To generate a new subproblem of N nodes just run:

```sh
just subproblem {N}
```
